			Among the many reasons that make Indian food a popular 
			cuisine across the globe, one is the use of aromatic spices that make the meal an 
			absolute treat. Yes, it could also be hot and spicy for some, but if you can get past 
            that then you will find it hard to resist the various kinds of curries and stir-fries that grace the Indian table. 
            Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.
         Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.

Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling, among many others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.

The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across different parts of the world. In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods, while less-developed areas raise chickens using more traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth today, making them outnumber humans more than two to one.
The modern chicken is a descendant of red junglefowl hybrids along with the grey junglefowl first raised thousands of years ago in the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent.[4]

Chicken as a meat has been depicted in Babylonian carvings from around 600 BC.[5] Chicken was one of the most common meats available in the Middle Ages.For thousands of years, a number of different kinds of chicken have been eaten across most of the Eastern hemisphere,including capons, pullets, and hens. It was one of the basic ingredients in blancmange, a stew usually consisting of chicken and fried onions cooked in milk and seasoned with spices and sugar.

In the United States in the 1800s, chicken was more expensive than other meats and it was "sought by the rich because [it is] so costly as to be an uncommon dish."Chicken consumption in the U.S. increased during World War II due to a shortage of beef and pork.In Europe, consumption of chicken overtook that of beef and veal in 1996, linked to consumer awareness of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease).

			Beef
		</div>
		<p>
            Beef, flesh of mature cattle, as distinguished from veal, the flesh of calves. The best beef is obtained from early maturing, special beef breeds. High-quality beef has firm, velvety, fine-grained lean, bright red in colour and well-marbled. The fat is smooth, creamy white, and well distributed. In young beef the bones are soft, porous, and red; the less desirable mature beef has hard white bones. Beef tenderness and flavour are improved by aging; in one common aging method the carcass is hung for about two weeks at approximately 36 °F (2 °C), encouraging physical changes in the muscle tissue that enhance the quality of the meat.
            Grading standards are somewhat similar in various countries; there is a large international beef trade. In the United States, grades in order of quality are prime, choice, good, commercial, utility, cutter, and canner. Commercial grades are mainly from mature cattle, especially cows. Utility, cutter, and canner grades are used in processed meat products. Beef hide, used for leather manufacture, is a valuable by-product of beef.
            Chicken-fried steak, a battered, pan-fried steak dish popular in the southern United States. The meat—usually tenderized cube steak—is dipped in a milk or egg wash, dredged through seasoned flour, and fried in a skillet. It is served smothered in a creamy gravy, traditionally made with pan drippings. Chicken-fried steak, also called country-fried steak, is commonly believed to have originated in Texas, the product of German and Austrian immigrants who adapted the dish from wiener schnitzel, which is similarly cooked but uses veal and breadcrumbs.


            The primary beef-consuming countries of the world (in per capita terms) are Uruguay, Argentina, New Zealand, Australia, and the United States. Beef is relatively scarce—and not particularly popular—in most of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent; the sanctity of the cow in the Hindu religion forbids the consumption of its meat by Hindu adherents. Beef is not unusual in the cuisines of Korea and Japan, however; in Kōbe, Japan, near Ōsaka, a highly prized beef is produced from cattle that are vigorously massaged and fed a liberal dietary supplement of beer.

			Homemade sushi will never be at the level of sushi from the top sushi restaurants in NYC, but here’s where homemade sushi wins:
			You get to gorge yourself on a sushi FEAST for like $20, whereas a similar amount of sushi at a restaurant would cost a couple hundred. 
            Soooooo worth it, if you ask me.
            I’ll be very honest and say that there’s definitely a reason why chefs spend a decade learning how to perfect sushi rice or cut raw fish like a boss, because it does make a difference.

And you know what else? Sushi is really fun to make at home.

My husband and I first made it several years ago for Valentine’s Day as a way to avoid the restaurant craze and spend time together making a special meal, and now it has become a tradition for us every year. And we love it so much we can’t limit it to one day a year anymore, and make it on occasion for dinner.

We are fortunate to have access to sushi grade raw fish, but you can still make sushi at home if you can’t find some. Shrimp tempura rolls are one of my favorites, or you could do a California roll or a veggie roll. One of our favorites is a Philly roll, with smoked salmon, cream cheese, avocado, and cucumber.

Or if you want to try something a little different, you can make Korean Kim Bap. It’s fairly similar to sushi, but no raw fish.
What seaweed should you use for sushi recipes?
To get started, you need the right kind of seaweed. The one on the left below is thick and perfect for rolling sushi (this is the one I use). The one on the right is too flimsy. I use that seaweed for snacking. Make sure you get seaweed specific for sushi-making, which it should state on the package.
Spread the seaweed with a layer of prepared sushi rice (this whole post covers how to make the rice), and flatten gently with a rice paddle (but do not smash the rice, as my mom would always say):For my sushi this time, I got this gorgeous piece of salmon. It was a 1/2lb piece, and gave us enough fish for about 6 rolls, plus some snacking. Even at $28/lb, which seems like a lot, paying $14 for that much fish is certainly worth it, and dirt cheap if you ask me!
